# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails dbseed command (or created alongside the database with dbsetup).

# Examples
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name 'Star Wars' }, { name 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name 'Luke', movie movies.first)
